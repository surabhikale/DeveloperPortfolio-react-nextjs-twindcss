      <p className="mb-3">
        After completing my Master of Science in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Software Technologies</span>, I embarked
        on my career as a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Junior Android Developer</span> and
        steadily grew into a{" "}

        <span className="font-medium">

        level of <span className="font-medium">attention to detail</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">technical writing ability</span>. My
        ability to work both <span className="italic">independently</span> and
        collaboratively, combined with my{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">self-motivation</span>, ensures that I
        meet deadlines and deliver quality results.
